## Show me how it's done
The implementation uses `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet` and can be viewed in `src/pages/index.js`. 

Make sure to update global api key and project api key values.
 
If it doesn't work, post on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/usersnap/public/issues).

If you need help on how to use the api, see our [documentation](https://help.usersnap.com/docs/flexible-use-cases-for-global-snippet).
